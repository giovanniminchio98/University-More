<h1> About Big Data</h1>

This folder contains a few scripts done in the course "Big Data" during my first year of Master Degree (<b>@University of Padua</b>, specialization in <b>AI and robotis</b>).
This course was not mandatory, but I ve choosen it since was my first ever that went really deep into big data algorithms and code exmaples (like this homework). <br>

I've done the exam: <br>
    1. in : **September 2021** <br>
    2. grade : **23** <br>
<hr>

    Notes :   low grade. My preparation in terms of coding ability and overall preparation was fine. I leacked in some theorem's proof...<br>
    In my defense : from July 2021 to December 2021 I had hard times with the university, wasn't sure anymore to continue my path (even tho it was already going on). Fortunately, after a Stage (full time, in an interesting Start-Up) I found my way again !!<br>
    Proud to say that my studies are still going :)

> <b>ps: </b> 
> Honestly I havent understood yet if a higher grade is better or not, sometimes it is achived trying the exam many times...It would mean to delay the study progression... for what?? Beign actually better than before? or  Just have a +0.2 in the overall average?
>I havent figured out the answer yet... <br>
