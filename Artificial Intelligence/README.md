<h1> Artificial Intelligence</h1>
In this folder you can find some projects/notes done for <b>AI</b> course followed during my first year of Master Degree (<b>@University of Padua</b>, specialization in <b>AI and robotis</b>).
</br>
This course war purely theoretical so I have no projects or codes of any kind to show....<br>
<hr>
<b>Bonus content: </b> the BOT_CLEAN.ipynb file is an example of Ai coding exercise done from hackerRank. I have done it since is about a topic and example done first weeks of this course example (in maybe 5 mins, maybe less...) <br> Literally the same script is also in the hackerRank folder...I guess i should link it rather that double it...<br>
<hr>


I've done the exam: <br>
    1. in : **July 2021** <br>
    2. grade : **30L** <br>
<hr>

    Notes :   High grade. nothing to point out about the course, perhaps too theoretical ...
<br>
<br>

> <b>ps: </b> 
> Honestly I havent understood yet if a higher grade is better or not, sometimes it is achived trying the exam many times...It would mean to delay the study progression... for what?? Beign actually better than before? or  Just have a +0.2 in the overall average?
>I havent figured out the answer yet... <br>
>This is my personal opinion<br><br>
